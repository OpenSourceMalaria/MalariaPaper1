	Abstract = {A novel intramolecular hydroacylation of 5- and 6-alkynals leading to alpha-alkylidenecycloalkanones was accomplished by using cationic a rhodium(I)/BINAP complex. For all cyclizations described, a single (E)-olefin isomer was obtained. At elevated temperature, hydroacylation and double bond migration of 5- and 6-alkynals proceeded in a one-pot reaction to give cycloalkenones. An intramolecular hydroacylation of a 7-alkynal was unsuccessful. This method represents an attractive new route to highly functionalized alpha-alkylidenecycloalkanones and cycloalkenones.},

@article{Aurrecoechea:1999ws,
	Abstract = {A SmI2/Pd(0)-promoted intramolecular coupling between propargylic esters and carbonyl compounds is described. The reaction affords homopropargyl cycloalkanol products. Cyclopentanols are formed in high yields when ketones are employed as the carbonyl components, but aldehydes are found not to be suitable partners in these reactions. Particularly remarkable is the efficient formation of products with adjacent functionalized quaternary centers. These cyclizations take place with low diastereoselectivity about the newly created propargylic and carbinol stereogenic centers except when these two centers are quaternary or in the presence of groups capable of both chelating trivalent samarium and facilitating retroaldol−aldol-type equilibria in the product. In this latter case, the strategic combination of chemoselective carbonyl addition and SmI2/Pd(0)-promoted cyclization provides ready and convenient stereocontrolled access to functionalized cyclopentanols from unprotected 1,5-dicarbonyl starting materials. The analogous formation of cyclohexanols is limited by low cyclization yields and lack of stereoselectivity.},

	Abstract = {The olefin cross-metathesis (CM) reaction is used extensively in organic chemistry and represents a powerful method for the selective synthesis of differentially substituted alkene products. Surprisingly, efforts to integrate this remarkable process into strategies for aromatic and heteroaromatic construction have not been reported. Such structures represent key elements of the majority of small molecule drug compounds; methods for the controlled preparation of highly substituted derivatives are essential to medicinal chemistry. Here we show that the olefin CM reaction, in combination with an acid cocatalyst or subsequent Heck arylation, provides a concise and flexible entry to 2,5-di- or 2,3,5-tri-substituted furans. These cascade processes portend further opportunities for the regiocontrolled preparation of other highly substituted aromatic and heteroaromatic classes.},

In the hydroacylation reaction, chelation of both salicylaldehyde and diene to the Rh-complex plays a crucial role. The ratio of iso- and normal-hydroacylated products could be regulated by the addition of salicylic acid or amines. The effects of various Rh-complexes, solvents, and additives were examined, and the plausible mechanisms of the catalytic cycle were proposed on the basis of the deuterium-labeling salicylaldehyde experiments.},

The hydroacylation reaction of 2-vinyl benzaldehyde had been previously reported to give a low yield of indanone and an unidentified product. We have identified this compound as a dimer of the starting material. Substitution at the alpha-position of the 2-vinyl benzaldehyde substrates blocks the competitive dimerization reaction and allows the reaction to proceed with yields generally greater than 90\%. Utilization of BINAP as a chiral ligand results in good chemical yields and enantioselectivity greater than 95\% in most cases.},

	Abstract = {Treatment of trans-4-hexenal-1-d with RhCl(PPh3)3 (I) in C6 H6 afforded 2-methylcyclopentanone-3-d and -2-d (II-3-d, and II-2-d) in 9/1 ratio when the reaction was carried to a low conversion. The deuterium in the II-3-d product was found to be cis to the C(2) methyl group by analysis of the 270 MHz 1H and 41.4 MHz 2H NMR spectra. This analysis was assisted by the synthesis of II-cis-2,3-d2 by treatment of 2-methylcyclopent-2-en-1-one with D2 and I. The 270 MHz 1H and 41.4 MHz 2H spectra of II-cis-2,3-d2 and of II-2,5,5-d3 were instrumental in the assignments of proton resonances in spectra of II-3-d. The results demonstrated that the cyclization of 4-hexenal-1-d occurred by a syn addition of the C---D bond to the olefinic bond to generate II-3-d. The results were interpreted in terms of a mechanism involving intervention of an acylrhodium(III) hydride complex and organorhodium(III) intermediates derived therefrom.},

	Abstract = {The kinetics and mechanism of intramolecular hydroacylation catalyzed by complexes Co2($\mu$-N2)(PPh3)6 (III) and (PPh3)2Co(dppe) (IV) (dppe-1,2-bis(di-phenylphosphino)ethane) were studied. The active monomeric 17-electron intermediate, (Ph3P)2Co(CH2=CHCH2CH2CHO) (Vb) was isolated in the cyclisation of 4-pentenal (I), catalyzed by complex III. Crystals of Vb are stable in an inert atmosphere at room temperature for a month. A well defined EPR spectrum of Vb in toluene glass at 77 K was obtained. According to the IR spectrum of complex Vb aldehyde I is bonded to the metal as a bidentate $\pi$,$\pi$-ligand. The ligand exchange reaction was found to proceed readily between Vb and dppe to form free I (85\%) and Co(dppe)2. The complex Vb is the first example of a cobalt(0) complex with a coordinated aidehyde group. The analogous intermediate, (dppe)Co(CH2=CHCH2-CH2CHO) (Va) was identified by EPR in solution during the 4-pentenal cyclization, catalyzed by complex IV. For the 4-pentenal hydroacylation reaction, catalyzed by complex Vb, zero and first order kinetic laws were found for the aldehyde I and the catalyst concentrations respectively in accordance with the equation: W0 = k[Vb], k = (8.5 $\pm$ 0.5) × 10−4 s−1 at 70$\,^{\circ}$C. It is suggested that the reaction mechanism involves oxidative addition of coordinated I to cobalt(0) within the complex Vb to give an acyl hydride intermediate (rate-determining step). The subsequent rearrangement of the acyl hydride complex to the acylalkylcobalt derivative, followed by a reductive elimination reaction yields the ketone II and the parent cobalt(0) complex. Unlike well-known catalytic processes, in which diamagnetic CoI and CoIII species are key intermediates, the catalytic cycle of the intramolecular hydroacylation reaction seems to involve only mononuclear paramagnetic Co0 and CoII species. Chelation of the cobalt atom by an unsaturated aldehyde was found to be an important requirement for this reaction to occur.},

@article{Lenges:1998hs,
	Abstract = {The mechanistic details of the cobalt-catalyzed intermolecular hydroacylation reaction have been investigated using kinetic, spectroscopic, and crystallographic methods. The Co(I) bisolefin complex 1, [C5Me5Co(C2H3SiMe3)2], was shown to catalyze the addition of a series of alkyl aldehydes (2a−l) to vinylsilanes to give the corresponding ketones with exclusive anti-Markovnikov selectivity under mild conditions. The catalytic cycle exhibits two resting states, complex 1 and a bisalkyl carbonyl complex, [C5Me5Co(CO)(R)(R`)], 4a−l which are in equilibrium. Kinetic investigations along with low-temperature NMR spectroscopy establish a sensitive balance between resting states during catalysis which is strongly dependent on substrate structure. The turnover-limiting step was established as the reductive elimination of ketone from intermediate 4. Using ferrocenecarboxaldehyde (Fc-C(O)H), 2l, as substrate, the intermediate 4l [C5Me5Co(CO)(Fc)(CH2CH2SiMe3)] was isolated at low temperatures and characterized by X-ray crystallography. Complex 4l was used to study the carbon−carbon bond-forming step directly by thermolysis in the presence of a trapping ligand L (P(OMe)3, PMe3). Kinetic analysis showed competitive ligand dependent and ligand independent pathways for ketone formation. Deuterium scrambling, isomerization of aldehydes prior to ketone formation, and production of isomeric ketones in certain cases establish that complex isomerization processes occur prior to productive ketone elimination from 4. A detailed mechanism accounting for all observations is proposed. Catalyst deactivation was shown to involve primarily decarbonylation to yield [C5Me5Co(CO)]2 and [C5Me5Co(CO)(C2H3SiMe3)]. When excess aldehyde is present, catalytic aldehyde dimerization occurs to give esters.},

	Abstract = {Under the conditions of ruthenium-catalyzed transfer hydrogenation, isoprene couples to benzylic and aliphatic alcohols 1a-g to deliver beta,gamma-unsaturated ketones 3a-g in good to excellent isolated yields. Under identical conditions, aldehydes 2a-g couple to isoprene to provide an identical set of beta,gamma-unsaturated ketones 3a-g in good to excellent isolated yields. As demonstrated by the coupling of butadiene, myrcene, and 1,2-dimethylbutadiene to representative alcohols 1b, 1c, and 1e, diverse acyclic dienes participate in transfer hydrogenative coupling to form beta,gamma-unsaturated ketones. In all cases, complete branch regioselectivity is observed, and, with the exception of adduct 3j, isomerization to the conjugated enone is not detected. Thus, formal intermolecular diene hydroacylation is achieved from the alcohol or aldehyde oxidation level. In earlier studies employing a related ruthenium catalyst, acyclic dienes were coupled to carbonyl partners from the alcohol or aldehyde oxidation level to furnish branched homoallylic alcohols. Thus, under transfer hydrogenative coupling conditions, all oxidation levels of substrate (alcohol or aldehyde) and product (homoallyl alcohol or beta,gamma-unsaturated ketone) are accessible.},

@article{Pawley:2010ye,
	Abstract = {Rhodium(III) dihydrido complexes [Rh(L2)(H)2(acetone)][BArF4] (ArF = C6H3(CF3)2) containing the potentially hemilabile ligands L2 = 9,9-dimethyl-4,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)xanthene (Xantphos) and [Ph2P(CH2)2]2O (POP′) have been prepared from their corresponding norbornadiene rhodium(I) precursors. In solution these complexes are fluxional by proposed acetone dissociation, which can be trapped out by addition of MeCN to form [Rh(L2)(H)2(NCMe)][BArF4], which have been crystallographically characterized. Addition of alkene (methyl acrylate) to these complexes results in reduction to a rhodium(I) species and when followed by addition of the aldehyde HCOCH2CH2SMe affords the new acyl hydrido complexes [Rh(L2)(COCH2CH2SMe)H][BArF4] in good yield. The solid-state and solution structures show a tight binding of the POP′ and Xantphos ligands, having a trans-arrangement of the phosphines with the central ether linkage bound. This is similar to the previously reported complex [Rh(DPEphos)(COCH2CH2SMe)H][BArF4] (DPEphos = [Ph2P(C6H4)]2O). Unlike the DPEphos complex, the Xantphos and POP′ ligated complexes are not effective catalysts for the hydroacylation reaction between methyl acrylate and HCOCH2CH2SMe. This is traced to their inability to dissociate the central ether link in a hemilabile manner to reveal a vacant site necessary for alkene coordination. Consistent with this lack of availability of the vacant site, these complexes also are stable toward reductive decarbonylation. Complexes [Rh(Ph2P(CH2)nPPh2)(acetone)2][BArF4] (n = 2−5) have also been studied as catalysts for the hydroacylation reaction between methyl acrylate and HCOCH2CH2SMe at 22 $\,^{\circ}$C. As found previously, for n = 2 this affords the product of alkene hydroacylation, but as the chain length is progressively increased to n = 5, the reaction also progressively changes to favor the product of aldehyde hydroacylation. This is suggested to occur by a decrease in the accessibility of the metal site on increasing the bite angle of the chelate ligand, so that alkene coordination to a putative Rh(III)-acyl hydrido intermediate is progressively disfavored and aldehyde coordination (followed by hydride transfer) is progressively favored. These, and previous, results show that the overall conversion in the hydroacylation reaction can be controlled by the hemilabile nature of the chelating phosphine in the catalyst (e.g., DPEphos versus Xantphos), and the course of the reaction can also be tuned by changing the bite angle of the phosphine, cf. Ph2P(CH2)2PPh2 and Ph2P(CH2)5PPh2.},

Herein we communicate the first atom-economical approach to phthalides by using enantioselective ketone hydroacylation. In the presence of Rh[(Duanphos)]X (X = NO(3), OTf, OMs), various 2-ketobenzaldehydes undergo intramolecular hydroacylation to produce phthalide products in good yields and 92-98\% ee's. Our study highlights the key role counterions play in controlling both reactivity and enantioselectivity. A concise asymmetric total synthesis of the celery extract (S)-(-)-3-n-butylphthalide is also presented.},

@article{Shen:2009ij,
	Abstract = {[Rh((R)-DTBM-SEGPHOS)]BF(4) catalyzes the intramolecular hydroacylation of ketones to afford seven-membered lactones in large enantiomeric excess. Herein, we present a combined experimental and theoretical study to elucidate the mechanism and origin of selectivity in this C-H bond activation process. Evidence is presented for a mechanistic pathway involving three key steps: (1) rhodium(I) oxidative addition into the aldehyde C-H bond, (2) insertion of the ketone CO double bond into the rhodium hydride, and (3) C-O bond-forming reductive elimination. Kinetic isotope effects and Hammett plot studies support that ketone insertion is the turnover-limiting step. Detailed kinetic experiments were performed using both 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane (dppp) and (R)-DTBM-SEGPHOS as ligands. With dppp, the keto-aldehyde substrate assists in dissociating a dimeric precatalyst 8 and binds an active monomeric catalyst 9. With [Rh((R)-DTBM-SEGPHOS)]BF(4), there is no induction period and both substrate and product inhibition are observed. In addition, competitive decarbonylation produces a catalytically inactive rhodium carbonyl species that accumulates over the course of the reaction. Both mechanisms were modeled with a kinetics simulation program, and the models were consistent with the experimental data. Density functional theory calculations were performed to understand more elusive details of this transformation. These simulations support that the ketone insertion step has the highest energy transition state and reveal an unexpected interaction between the carbonyl-oxygen lone pair and a Rh d-orbital in this transition state structure. Finally, a model based on the calculated transition-state geometry is proposed to rationalize the absolute sense of enantioinduction observed using (R)-DTBM-SEGPHOS as the chiral ligand.},

@article{Dudnik:2008ve,
	Abstract = {A general, mild, and efficient 1,2-migration/cycloisomerization methodology toward multisubstituted 3-thio-, seleno-, halo-, aryl-, and alkyl-furans and pyrroles, as well as fused heterocycles, valuable building blocks for synthetic chemistry, has been developed. Moreover, regiodivergent conditions have been identified for C-4 bromo- and thio-substituted allenones and alkynones for the assembly of regioisomeric 2-hetero substituted furans selectively. It was demonstrated that, depending on reaction conditions, ambident substrates can be selectively transformed into furan products, as well as undergo selective 6-exo-dig or Nazarov cyclizations. Our mechanistic investigations have revealed that the transformation proceeds via allenylcarbonyl or allenylimine intermediates followed by 1,2-group migration to the allenyl sp carbon during cycloisomerization. It was found that 1,2-migration of chalcogens and halogens predominantly proceeds via formation of irenium intermediates. Analogous intermediate can also be proposed for 1,2-aryl shift. Furthermore, it was shown that the cycloisomerization cascade can be catalyzed by Br\o nsted acids, albeit less efficiently, and commonly observed reactivity of Lewis acid catalysts cannot be attributed to the eventual formation of proton. Undoubtedly, thermally induced or Lewis acid-catalyzed transformations proceed via intramolecular Michael addition or activation of the enone moiety pathways, whereas certain carbophilic metals trigger carbenoid/oxonium type pathway. However, a facile cycloisomerization in the presence of cationic complexes, as well as observed migratory aptitude in the cycloisomerization of unsymmetrically disubstituted aryl- and alkylallenes, strongly supports electrophilic nature for this transformation. Full mechanistic details, as well as the scope of this transformation, are discussed.},

It was found that under mild conditions mono- or di-substituted hydrazine derivatives were obtained in good to excellent yield. Furthermore, it was shown that one of the two Boc-groups of the disubstituted derivatives was selectively removed by heating, leading to precursors for trisubstituted hydrazines.},

	Abstract = {[reaction: see text] This paper describes cobalt-mediated cross-coupling reactions of alkyl halides with 1-(trimethylsilyl)ethenylmagnesium bromide and 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethynylmagnesium bromide, respectively. The cobalt system allows for employing secondary as well as primary alkyl halides as the substrates. The reactions offer facile formations of alkyl-alkenyl and alkyl-alkynyl bonds. The reaction mechanism would include single-electron transfer from a cobalt complex to alkyl halide to generate the corresponding alkyl radical. The cobalt system thus enables sequential radical cyclization/alkenylation and cyclization/alkynylation reactions of 6-halo-1-hexene derivatives.},

In this reaction, carbon monoxide is not needed to suppress decarbonylation of aldehydes. The key intermediate is an (acyl)(3-allyl)ruthenium complex which undergoes reductive elimination to give the corresponding ketones.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: The series of platinum acetylide oligomers (PAOs) with the general structure trans,trans-[(RO)3Ph-CC-Pt(PMe3)2-CC-(Ar)-CC-Pt(PMe3)2-CC-Ph(OR)3], where Ar = 1,4-phenylene, 2,5-thienylene, or bis-2,5-(S-2-methylbutoxy)-1,4-phenylene and R = n-C12H25 gel hydrocarbon solvents at concentrations above 1 mM. Gelation is thermally reversible (Tgel-sol 40-50 C), and it occurs due to aggregation of the PAOs resulting in the formation of a fibrous network that is observed for dried gels imaged by TEM. The influence of aggregation/gelation on the photophysical properties of the PAOs is explored in detail. Aggregation induces a significant blue shift in the oligomers' absorption spectra, and the shift is attributed to exciton interactions arising from H-aggregation of the chromophores. Strong circular dichroism (CD) is observed for gelled solutions of a PAO substituted with homochiral S-2-methylbutoxy side chains on the central phenylene unit. The CD is attributed to formation of a chiral supramolecular aggregate structure. The PAOs are phosphorescent at ambient temperature in solution and in the aggregate/gel state. The phosphorescence band is blue-shifted ca. 20 nm in the aggregate/gel, and the shift is assigned to emission from an unrelaxed conformation of the triplet excited state. Phosphorescence spectroscopy of mixed aggregate/gels consisting of a triplet donor/host oligomer (Ar = 1,4-phenylene) doped with low concentrations of an acceptor/trap oligomer (Ar = 2,5-thienylene) indicates that energy transfer occurs efficiently in the aggregates. Triplet energy transfer involves exciton diffusion among the host chromophores followed by Dexter exchange energy transfer to the trap chromophore.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: Rhodium (I) bis-olefin complexes Cp*Rh(VTMS)2 and CpRh(VTMS)2 (Cp* = C5Me5, Cp = C5Me4CF3, VTMS = vinyl trimethylsilane) were found to catalyze the addition of aromatic aldehydes to olefins to form ketones. Use of the more electron-deficient catalyst CpRh(VTMS)2 results in faster reaction rates, better selectivity for linear ketone products from -olefins, and broader reaction scope. NMR studies of the hydroacylation of vinyltrimethylsilane showed that the starting Rh(I) bis-olefin complexes and the corresponding Cp*/Rh(CH2CH2SiMe3)(CO)(Ar) complexes were catalyst resting states, with an equilibrium established between them prior to turnover. Mechanistic studies suggested that CpRh(VTMS)2 displayed a faster turnover frequency (relative to Cp*Rh(VTMS)2) because of an increase in the rate of reductive elimination, the turnover-limiting step, from the more electron-deficient metal center of CpRh(VTMS)2. Reaction of Cp*/Rh(CH2CH2SiMe3)(CO)(Ar) with PMe3 yields acyl complexes Cp*/Rh[C(O)CH2CH2SiMe3](PMe3)(Ar); measured first-order rates of reductive elimination of ketone from these Rh(III) complexes established that the Cp ligand accelerates this process relative to the Cp* ligand.},

	Abstract = {The first organocatalytic enantioselective 1,6-addition of beta-ketoesters and benzophenone imine to electron-poor delta-unsubstituted dienes using cinchona alkaloids under phase-transfer conditions is demonstrated. The scope of the reaction for the beta-ketoesters is outlined for reactions with different delta-unsubstituted dienes having ketones, esters, and sulfones as electron-withdrawing substituents giving the corresponding optically active products in good yields and enantioselectivities in the range of 90-99% ee. The 1,6-addition also proceeds with a number of cyclic beta-ketoesters having different ring sizes, ring systems and substituents in high yields and enantioselectivities. The potential of this new organocatalytic 1,6-addition for beta-ketoesters is demonstrated by a two-step synthesis of the bicyclo[3.2.1]octan-8-one structure, a bicyclic bridged skeleton occurring in a variety of natural compounds. Benzophenone imines also undergo the organocatalytic asymmetric 1,6-addition to the activated dienes in high yields and with enantioselectivities from 92% to 98% ee, except in one case. The synthetic utility of this asymmetric reaction is demonstrated by the two-step transformation of the allylated alpha-amino acid derivative to highly attractive optically active pyrrolidines.},

	Abstract = {The mechanism of Rh(ii)-catalysed cyclopropanation has been investigated computationally using Rh(2)(formate)(4) as a model precatalyst, with the model organic substrates CH(2)N(2) and C(2)H(4) and MeCl as a model for coordinating solvent. Three potential carriers of catalysis have been identified, one retaining the Rh(2)(formate)(4) framework and two others resulting from ligand insertion of Rh-CH(2) into an Rh-O bond. Both 2 + 1 and 2 + 2 pathways have been identified for the cyclopropanation step depending on the catalytic carrier involved. Complexes resulting from CH(2) insertion into the Rh-O bond are more efficient at lowering the activation enthalpy for CH(2)-N(2) scission in the rate determining step.},

	Abstract = {A reaction cascade comprising a rhodium-catalyzed C-H activation, a subsequent hydrometalation of an alkylidene cyclopropane in vicinity, regioselective C-C bond activation of the flanking cyclopropane ring, followed by reductive elimination of the resulting metallacycle, opens a new entry into functionalized cycloheptene derivatives. This crossover of C-H activation and higher order cycloaddition has been performed in two different formats, either using alkylidenecyclopropanes with a lateral vinylpyridine moiety or with a pending aldehyde group as the trigger. The reaction tolerates various functional groups, leaves chiral centers alpha to the reacting sites unaffected, and proceeds with excellent stereoselectivity. Labeling experiments support the proposed mechanism explaining the observed net cycloisomerization process.},

These studies have led to Rh(I) complexes that catalyze these reactions in minutes at room temperature or in water without organic solvents. We describe a comparative evaluation of several chiral catalysts for the [5 + 2] reaction, evaluation of a preferred catalyst, [((R)-BINAP)Rh]+SbF6-, with substrates differing in substitution and tether types-producing enantiomeric excesses >/=95% for several systems. A predictive model for the selectivity is also presented.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: 2,6-Disubstituted N-aryl ureas rotate slowly about their ArN bonds and can exist as separable atropisomers. They also react remarkably diastereoselectively, with the urea axis controlling new stereogenic centers with high fidelity in a variety of nucleophilic and electrophilic addition reactions. The sense of diastereoselectivity in lateral lithiationelectrophilic quench reactions is electrophile-dependent and appears to be the result of stereospecific reaction with one of two interconvertible diastereoisomeric organolithiums.},
