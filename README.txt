## About

This is the working directory for the first OSDD malaria paper. For project info see:

http://www.thesynapticleap.org
http://openwetware.org/wiki/OSDDMalaria
http://www.twitter/OSDDMalaria

It used to be linked to a svn repository administered by Paul M. Ylioja. Now it's in github. Don't worry, just make changes as you would to a normal file and we'll deal with the version tracking but if you wish/can use git then please do so.

If you make changes and feel like doing so log your changes in this file. Don't worry if you don't have the time, we don't have too much many people to keep track of at the moment.

## Document

The doc file contains the current text, schemes, figures and tables for the draft paper.

## Experimental

The experimental folder contains LaTeX files, chemdraw .cdx and pdf files for the experimental/supporting information section of the paper.
