## About

This was the working directory for the first OSM paper. The paper is under review and this repo is not up to date and is awaiting archiving/deletion.

The paper is at draft stage and anyone is invited to suggest changes/corrections at this stage. This paper is in no way publishable at this stage and all results are to be treated as preliminary/pending confirmation until after publication in peer-reviewed journals.

## Instructions for new/non-Git users

The point of having this document here is that we can track changes to multiple files and allow us to track back to older versions of the draft document. We encourage you to sign-up to GitHub and install the client which will allow you to make work with the document directly. This will allow you to fork the repository (the document and all associated files) and inform us of the changes. Feel free to do this without telling us of your intentions.

However, if you would prefer, feel free to download the file, make any relevant changes you wish and send the amended file to us by email/dropbox/whatever and we can review the changes and make the changes on your behalf (accrediting you in the process if you wish). If you wish to contribute its important for us that you are able to do so easily so just feel free to work how you wish to and we're willing to put in a bit more work to let you do so.


## Main Document

The .docx file contains the current text, embedded .cdx schemes, figures and tables for the draft paper.

## Experimental

The experimental folder contains LaTeX files, chemdraw .cdx and pdf files for the experimental/supporting information section of the paper.

## Optional Log for non-Git users

If you're a non-Git user and you make changes, it would be great if you were to also update this log with a short description of the changes you've made. If you are emailing us an edited file you can alternatively leave a description within the email if you prefer.
